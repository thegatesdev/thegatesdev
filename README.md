### Hello there!

I am usually called Tim around here. Scarily generic, I know.

# Overview

I am currently **studying** for Software Developer.

In my free time I like to **code** in Java and TypeScript, often related to Minecraft.
My favourite web framework is [Astro](https://astro.build/).
When my energy runs out, I'll play some **games** including Minecraft and any other I come across.
When I'm feeling particularly creative, I'll practice my digital **drawing** skills.
