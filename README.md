*Hello there!*

# About

Usually called Tim around here. Scarily generic, I know.

I am currently **studying** for Software Developer.

# Activities

Things I like to do in my free time:
- I like to **code** in Java, related to the Minecraft game, or in any other language for game and web development.
- When my energy runs out I'll play some **games** including Minecraft and other random games I come across.
- When I'm feeling particularly creative I'll do some **digital art**, usually in cartoon / anime style.

My current active coding project is the **The Witheronia Network**, a Minecraft minigame and RPG network.
