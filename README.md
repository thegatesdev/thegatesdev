*Hello there!*

# About

I'm usually called Tim.
Currently, I am studying for Software Developer. However, anything to do with computers has had my interest for years.

# Activities

Things I like to do in my free time:
- **Code**; mostly in Java (for Minecraft Java edition), but also a bit of web development.
- **Play games**; Minecraft, and other random games I come across.
- **Draw**; Digital art, cartoon / anime style.

My current active project is a Minecraft server network called **The Witheronia Network**.
