### Hello there!

I am usually called Tim around here. Scarily generic, I know.

# Overview

I am currently **studying** for Software Developer.

In my free time I like to **code** in Java and TypeScript, often related to Minecraft.
My favourite web framework is [Astro](https://astro.build/).
When my energy runs out, I'll play some **games** including Minecraft and any other I come across.
When I'm feeling particularly creative, I'll practice my digital **drawing** skills.

# Current Activities

- 💻 Designing and building a web app for managing Minecraft mods, resource packs and data packs.
- 🇳🇱  Keeping the [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/) Dutch translation up-to-date.
- 🔁 Committing to Minecraft related projects, updating them to new versions or improving the code.
- 🤖 Studying AI and it's implications.
