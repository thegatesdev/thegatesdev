# Hello there!

I am usually called Tim around here. Scarily generic, I know.

I am currently **studying** for Software Developer.

# Activities

Things I like to do in my free time:
- I like to **code** in Java, related to the Minecraft game, or in any other language for game and web development.
- When my energy runs out I'll play some **games** including Minecraft and other random games I come across.
- When I'm feeling particularly creative I'll do some **digital art**, usually in cartoon / anime style.

# Coding Projects

- **The Witheronia Network**, a Minecraft minigame and RPG network *that is way too ambitious*.
- **Maple**, a parser and data structure *for JSON and the like*.
- Other **random projects** not limited to C maze generation, utility apps and Minecraft plugins.
