*Hello there!*

# About

Usually called Tim around here. Scarily generic.
I am currently **studying** for Software Developer.

# Activities

Things I like to do in my free time:
- I like to **code** in Java, related to the Minecraft game, and also do a bit of web development.
- When my energy runs out, I'll play some **games** including Minecraft, and other random games I come across.
- When I'm feeling particularly creative, I'll do some **digital art**, usually in cartoon / anime style.

My current active coding project is a Minecraft server network called **The Witheronia Network**.

# Contact

You can find me on Discord under the tag `thegates`.
